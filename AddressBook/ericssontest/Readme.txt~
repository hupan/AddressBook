All functional requirements are satisfied.
All non-functional requirements are satisfied except for the testing coverage. I encountered a problem when running JUnit test through maven. It cannot get my input from terminal...

"Please input name to continue testing: "
"name : "
Then I enter a name and press "enter". The terminal blocks...

However through Eclipse there is no problem. I spend a long time trying to solve it but the result is not positive...Besides there is no enough time. This is the first time that I use cobertura. I am sure I can fix it if given a little bit more time.

I learned a lot of things through this little test. Thank you Ericsson!

Use "mvn clean install" for building up.
Use "mvn site" for generating javadoc and test reports.

Again, thank you for your help!
